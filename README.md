## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural design framework that frames software applications as a collection of freely linked and interoperable services. 

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Reusability are meant to be reused in a variety of scenarios. Once created, a service may be used by various applications, increasing efficiency and minimising redundancy in development efforts.

Discoverability frequently includes a service registry or directory where developers may discover and comprehend accessible services, hence encouraging the reuse of existing services within an organisation.

Scalability allows for the provision of services over several servers and platforms, enabling scalable and distributed systems. This is especially true in big and complicated corporate systems.

3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices is an architectural approach in which an application is structured as a collection of tiny, self-sufficient, and loosely connected services, each focusing on a single business feature.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-Easier Scaling and Resource Allocation because each microservice may be scaled separately, resources can be allocated more effectively based on demand for each service. This aids in optimising resource use and cost control.

Autonomy and decentralisation provide development teams control over specialised services. This decentralisation promotes creativity by empowering teams to make autonomous decisions about technology, development methods, and deployment tactics.

Microservices interact via well-defined APIs, making it easy to integrate new services and interoperate with other systems. This is very useful in complicated business situations.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- SOA and Microservices are both service-oriented architectural methods that emphasize the usage of services as the foundation of an application. Both designs advocate for loose coupling of services, which allows for greater flexibility and independence in development and deployment. Microservices, which frequently correlate with smaller, cross-functional teams, can have a substantial influence on organizational structure, but SOA governance structures may be more centralized.
